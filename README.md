[Live Deployment](https://f1-visualization.vercel.app/)

Built for CS7DS4

The Formula 1 Race visualizer is an unofficial visualizer of races from 1996 onwards. The site will update with the latest races after they happen.

Once you select a year and a round, you can select a lap or click play to see how the gap to the leader evolved over time.

You can click or hover over a driver for additional driver, constructor, and race information.
